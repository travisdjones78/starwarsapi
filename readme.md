#   **Welcome To Star Wars API**
This is my Star Wars API Project. es. So I will walk thru the steps you must take in order to make sure you get full use out of this. Here are the steps that will be taken:
- Installing all depedencies to give the project what it needs to run
- Starting up the server

Lets's get started!!
>###  **Server**
On the Server-Side of my application I used the following dependencies:  
- "body-parser": "^1.20.1",
- "cors": "^2.8.5",
- "express": "^4.18.2",
- "node-fetch": "^3.3.0",
- "nodemon": "^2.0.20"

These are the dependecies that I used. First we must open at terminal inside of the project folder. In order to get all of these installed we must run the following code:
```
npm install
```
This will install everything that is listed as `'dependencies'` in our package.json file.

That is all that needs to be done to get the server ready to go.

>###  **Starting The Server**

Now it is time to start our server. First open the terminal and type the following:
```
npm start
```
You should see the following:

![Server_start](./public/img/server_start.png "server_start")

Now Star Wars API is up & running ready to give you results. Enjoy!
